TODO in priority order

- Fix crash on disconnect during an active data transfer.
  In fact, check that scenario in general.

- Fix inactivity timer issue where a client might get 
  erroneously disconnected during data transfer.
  Need to not only keep track of control channel,
  but also data channel.

- PASSIVE mode. Seriously.

- PASSIVE mode config. Need to be able to define a port 
  range to be used for passive connections.

- Add more useful information about active connections.
